# Virtual Environment Manager (VENV)

Virtual Environment Manager (VENV) is a handy command-line tool for managing Python virtual environments effortlessly. It simplifies the process of creating, activating, deactivating, listing, and removing virtual environments, all in one place.

## Features

- üöÄ Easy virtual environment creation with a single command.
- üîå Activate and deactivate virtual environments with ease.
- üìã List all available virtual environments in your project directory.
- üóëÔ∏è Safely remove virtual environments when you no longer need them.
- üîÑ Automatically reloads your shell configuration to make aliases permanent.

## Installation

Before you begin, ensure you have `pip` installed. If not, please install `pip` first.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/venv-manager.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd venv-manager
   ```

3. Run the installation script:

   ```bash
